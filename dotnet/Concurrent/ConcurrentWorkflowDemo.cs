/// This demonstrates a concurrent workflow that:
/// 1. Takes a customer question as input
/// 2. Sends the question to multiple specialist agents simultaneously
/// 3. Collects and combines responses from all agents
/// 
/// Concepts covered:
/// - Fan-out Edges (distribute to multiple agents)
/// - Fan-in Edges (collect from multiple agents)
/// - AI Agent Integration
/// - Turn Tokens
/// - Streaming Execution
