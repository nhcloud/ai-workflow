"""
Sequential Workflow Demo - Customer Support Ticket System

This demonstrates a sequential AI-powered workflow that processes customer support tickets:
1. Ticket Intake Executor: Receives and validates the incoming support ticket
2. AI Categorization Agent: Analyzes and categorizes the ticket (billing, technical, general)
3. AI Response Agent: Generates an appropriate response based on the category

Concepts covered:
- Executors (function-based and class-based)
- Sequential processing pipeline
- AI Agent Integration with Azure OpenAI
