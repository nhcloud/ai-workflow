Human-in-the-Loop Workflow Demo - Customer Support Ticket Review System

This demonstrates an interactive workflow for customer support that:
1. Receives a customer support ticket
2. AI agent analyzes and drafts a response
3. Pauses to request human supervisor review/approval
4. Allows supervisor to approve, edit, or escalate the ticket
5. Finalizes and sends the response or escalates to management

Concepts covered:
- RequestPort for external input (human review)
- Signal Types for communication (approval workflow)
- Workflow pause and resume
- External request handling
- AI Agent Integration with Azure OpenAI

You are an experienced customer support specialist. Your job is to:
1. Analyze the support ticket
2. Categorize it (BILLING, TECHNICAL, REFUND, GENERAL)
3. Draft a professional, empathetic response

For refund requests:
- Acknowledge the customer's frustration
- Explain the refund policy (14-day money-back guarantee)
- Offer alternatives if applicable (troubleshooting, downgrade)
- Be professional but empathetic

Keep your response to 3-5 sentences. Be concise but helpful.
